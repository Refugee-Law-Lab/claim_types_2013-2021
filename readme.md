This is a repo to host data and code used in a paper, entiteld "Claim Types in Canada’s Refugee Determination System: An Empirical Snapshot (2013-2021)" that is forthcoming in Refuge (draft currently available on [SSRN](https://ssrn.com/abstract=4341740)).

The code used to process the data, as well as tables offering more granual details than the ones in the paper is available in a [notebook](https://github.com/Refugee-Law-Lab/claim_types_2013-2021/blob/main/1_Analyze_data.ipynb).

As discussed in detail in the paper, the underlying data cannot be shared due to a data sharing agreement with the Immigration and Refugee Board.

To faciliate research by other scholars, the [data sharing agreement](https://github.com/Refugee-Law-Lab/claim_types_2013-2021/blob/main/IRB_Data_Sharing_Agreement_2022.pdf) is reproduced in the repo as is the [access to information request](https://github.com/Refugee-Law-Lab/claim_types_2013-2021/blob/main/IRB_ATIP_Request_2022.pdf) used to obtain the data.

Note that the Refugee Law Laboratory is open to collaborating with university based researchers who would like to use this data, so long as that can be done in compliance with the data sharing agreement.
